export const INTRO_TEXT = `I enjoy reading articles and Substacks, but I’ve always preferred listening to podcasts since I’m a slow reader. Many publications now offer text-to-speech, but their speed-up features aren’t great, so I built this to mimic my favorite podcast app's smart speed up and slow-down feature.`;

export const INTRO_DETAILS = `This is my first experiment using your API, which I explored for the first time today. I initially tried features available only in the v3 model but realized I needed special access, so I switched to v2 for a simpler implementation. I really enjoyed searching your documentation - by voice! - to learn about the APIs, and I’m excited to eventually try v3 features like advanced tagging and normalization.`;

export const INTRO_IMPROVEMENTS = `I didn’t have access to all of v3's features, but I’ve already implemented how I would use it by referencing the docs. My current approach focuses on speeding up audio by adding small delays around important breaks in prose like paragraphs, punctuation, quotes, and other elements. I believe this is one way my favorite podcast app makes their sped up audio sound so natural.`;
