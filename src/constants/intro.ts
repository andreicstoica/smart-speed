I love both reading (especially articles and Substacks) and listening to podcasts, but listening to podcasts has always been prefered. I'm a very slow reader! It was exciting seeing many written publications start offering text-to-speech, but their implementations aren't great, especially when sped up. My favorite podcast app, Overcast, has a smart audio speed up feature that I wanted to emulate here but for any pasted text. My friends suggested I also add a slow down option for bedtime style help - some people watch YouTube videos to help them sleep!

This is my experiment using your API, which I became familiar with for the first time today. I initially tried using some features only present in your v3 model, but I found that I needed access, so I used v2 for a simpler approach. I really enjoyed being able to talk to your docs to learn more about your APIs, and am super excited to use some of the features in v3 like tagging and normalization!
